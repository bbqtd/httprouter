# httprouter

The convenient adapter
[julienschmidt/httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter). The
package doesn't do something essential except providing adapter and support
`context`. When [v2](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/projects/1)
will be released the package would be [useless,
see](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter/pull/147).
